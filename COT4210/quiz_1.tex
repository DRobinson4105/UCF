\maketitle

Since $L$ is regular, there exists a DFA $M$ that recognizes it.
\vspace{1em}

To construct an NFA $M'$ that recognizes $L^R$, first reverse all transition directions in $M$. Convert the original start state into an accept state. Introduce a new start state with an $\varepsilon$-transition to each of the original accept states, and convert those accept states into normal states.
\vspace{1em}

Since $M'$ is an NFA that recognizes $L^R$, and every NFA has an equivalent DFA, $L^R$ is also regular. Thus, the class of regular languages is closed under reversal.
