	// that leads to another compartment. It might fail to find a latch even if
	// one exists. If that's the case, there's also a small chance that this

	//    for a latch that leads to the next compartment in the box. If this
	//    method cannot find such a latch, it creates a new compartment and
	//    chooses a quadrant at random to link to that new compartment via that
	//    quadrant's latch.
	//
	// 2. This method is somewhat chaotic and might fail to find a latch if one
	//    exists. In that case, this method might overwrite an existing latch
	//    as it links this compartment to the next one, causing us to lose our
	//    reference to that other compartment and all the values it contains.
	//    Alternatively, this process might result in the box having multiple
	//    compartments branching off of this one.
